    "# Model Building Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main file for constructing machine learning models and building appropriate feature sets. The notebook is organized into four key sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Pre-Processing\n",
    "In this section, we will ensure the data is adequately processed for model building. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess the current state of data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify any additional features that need to be added to improve model efficiency.\n",
    "### 2. Model Building\n",
    "- Here, we will develop the initial models that will be trained on the data processed in the previous section. This section focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructing the models without fine-tuning or interpretation at this stage.\n",
    "### 3. Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "In this section, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train the models using the prepared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine if the model outputs are reliable and worth further consideration.\n",
    "### 4. Results\n",
    "The final section will involve analyzing the decision-making process of the models. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examine the results of linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more advanced algorithms, delve into both local and global interpretations to understand the decision-making of these \"black box\" models.\n"
